				<h2>Felaw Lake</h2>
				<p>Felaw lake is an area set on the fringe of the Halgurd-Sakran Mountains with a 
erfect alpine lake seemingly on the edge of the world,
teetering at the alley's periphery and surrounded by emerald-green grasses
and a flowering tree.
Across the valley is a ridge of snow-capped peaks that seem to loom over as you explore the lake.</p>

				<h2>ZORAGVAN</h2>
				<p>Zoragvan is a small valley located at Barzan
which is a town located along the Great Zab in Erbil Governorate, Kurdistan-Iraq.
It is one of the places that you can see the untouched nature.
In autumn season, the valley turns to a colorful place
making it one of the most beautiful place to photograph in Iraq.</p>

				<h2>GALY SHERANA</h2>
				<p>Gali Sherana in Duhok province has long offered tourists a refreshing break from summer temperatures,
but its crystal clear waters are even more welcome this year amidst drought conditions throughout the Kurdistan Region.
Despite the area's increasing popularity with tourists from the region and central and southern Iraq,
the remote mountain waterfalls and pools of Gali Sherana remained relatively untouched during a recent weekend visit.</p>
